My name is **Jiaxin Guo**(éƒ­ä½³é‘«), a fourth-year undergraduate student at Tsinghua University, China, planning to apply for a **Ph.D. program in Fall 2026**. Currently, I am a research intern at Microsoft Research Asia (MSRA), mentored by Dr. [Li Dong](https://dong.li/). Previously, I was fortunate to be hosted by Prof. [Tuo Zhao](https://www2.isye.gatech.edu/~tzhao80/) at Georgia Institute of Technology(GaTech), where I worked on adaptive knowledge distillation for speculative decoders.
